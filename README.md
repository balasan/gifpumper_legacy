legacy gifpumper code

Disclaimer:  

This code was written circa 2010 when I first got into web development.  It is a prototype of the gifpumper web app that I later rewrote in Node - http://gifpumper.com.  

This was before I learned about MVC, JS frameworks, templating etc. So there is an acute lack of organization and clarity. (See https://github.com/balasan/4real for an example of recent code using AngularJS and NodeJS)  

However it should suffice to demonstrate php knowledge. 

You can see a working example of this code here: http://momentsound.com/gifpumper_legacy

Controlls:
Drag to reposition images 
Shift-Drag images to resize
X-Drag to rotate in XY plane
Z-Drag to rotate in Z plane
Spacebar to toggle scene rotation
