legacy gifpumper code

Disclaimer:  

This code was written circa 2010 when I first got into web development.  It is a prototype of the gifpumper web app that I later rewrote in Node - http://gifpumper.com.  

This was before I learned about MVC, JS frameworks, templating etc. So there is an acute lack of organization and clarity.  
However it should suffice to demonstrate php knowledge. 

You can see a working example of this code here: http://momentsound.com/gifpumper-legacy
